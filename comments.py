comm=["1 - 25 of 79 Reviews for Python Project for AI & Application Development Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Gorge V•Mar 5, 2022This whole IBM specialization has been really bad. Everything is extremely superficial and not for beginners at all, but this one takes the cake. Definitely one of the worst courses I've ever took. From the barely explained videos to all the errors in the test environments to bad explained requirements and mistakes. This course has it all. There's also basically no human intervention, I don't know why each course on this specialization says made by X if all the videos are presented by a tiktok text-to-speech voice.I would not take this course again even if they paid me to.

Very very frustrating course, the lab instructions need to be more clear for a beginner python project.

It's getting offline every 5 minutes and restart making connactions every time, so you can wast 10x time really required for the job This is helpful (3)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy ANDERSON P C•Jan 1, 2023Instruction for the project are not clear enough, In my case the VM where I worked had an old version of python (3.6.9) which had problems with ssl module and connection with the translator in IBM cloud. Fortunately, this same VM had also python version 3.8 installed and I could do the tasks; however, I waste almost 4 hours of research to find one way to solve the issue which is nothing related to the course topics. Besides what I mentioned, the all specialization worth the time and the effort, I suggest keep improving the contents and updating the tools we students have to use.

This is helpful (2)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Daria A•Sep 29, 2021Very poor contect for non-programming specialists. I needed to take the course as a part of specialization, which resulted in me cancelling my participation. There not enough videos, examples, explanations - I have a feeling that one collected some topics, threw them together, created a digital voice to give the lectures - that's it. This was not the quality I expected. You chatbot colleagues did a much better job on the contect - please improve..This is helpful (2)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Anmol N•Jul 2, 2022scamedThis is helpful (2)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Kevin M•Jul 12, 2021I loved the course, it was hands-on lab with a through need for skills which you are taught previous in the python course.

However, the other courses may have too much information without additional hands-on practices such as using the IBM cloud services. I believe most students enrolled would need to go through the documentation on IBM to reinforce the learning and thus overlapping a lot of time spent on going through the documentation whereas the videos itself should be sufficiently enough to teach some aspects of the SaaS but the videos seem either too fast or very unhuman like. More like promoting IBM rather than teaching a lesson.This is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Wojciech J•Jul 31, 2022The course was really interesting, but Filled StarStarStarStarStar I believe that some things could be described with more details. The environment used in this course - theia - was really laggy for me and I spent a few extra hours on doing the labs and final project.This is helpful (1)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Ferenc H•Mar 1, 2023The instructions for the last project are extremely confusing, and some  of the links provided in the lab to clarify concepts are broken.  Although there is a support person available on the discussion board, I  found myself repeatedly encountering the same errors and receiving the  same advice to close the lab, clear cookies, and start again. This  course has been extremely frustrating, and the lab instructions need to  be clearer for someone with little experience in a Python project.This is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Teta B•Apr 15, 2023 Filled StarStarStarStarStar Python is a powerful and versatile programming language that is widely used for artificial intelligence (AI) and application development. Python offers an extensive collection of libraries, frameworks, and tools that facilitate the development of complex AI and application projects.One of the most popular AI frameworks in Python is TensorFlow, which allows developers to create deep learning models for a variety of tasks, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. TensorFlow offers a user-friendly interface, Filled StarStarStarStarStar which makes it easy to train, test, and deploy models. Another popular AI framework is PyTorch, which offers a dynamic computation graph that allows developers to build flexible and efficient models.For application development, Python offers a wide range of web frameworks such as Django and Flask that allow developers to build robust and scalable web applications. These frameworks provide features such as URL routing, request handling, and database integration, which simplify the development process. Additionally, Python offers libraries such as NumPy and Pandas, which provide data analysis and manipulation capabilities, making it easier to build applications that require data processing and analysis.One of the key advantages of Python is its ease of use and readability. Python's syntax is straightforward, and its code is easy to read and understand, making it an ideal choice for beginners and experienced developers alike. Additionally, Python's large and active community ensures that developers have access to a wealth of resources, including documentation, tutorials, and support forums.Overall, Python is an excellent choice for AI and application development projects. Its wide range of libraries and frameworks, combined with its ease of use and readability, Filled StarStarStarStarStar make it an ideal language for building complex projects. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, Python offers the tools and resources needed to build powerful AI and application projects.
